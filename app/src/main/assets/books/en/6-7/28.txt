GOODNIGHT MOON 


In the great green room
there was a telephone
and a red balloon
and a picture of
the cow jumping over the moon.
 
There were three little bears
sitting on chairs
and two little kittens
and a pair of mittens
and a little toyhouse
and a young mouse
and a comb and a brush
and a bowl full of mush
and a quiet old lady
who was whispering “hush.”
 
Good night room
Goodnight moon
Goodnight cow
jumping over the moon
Goodnight light
and the red balloon
 
Goodnight bears
Goodnight chairs
Goodnight kittens
and goodnight mittens
 
Goodnight clocks
and goodnight socks
Goodnight little house
and goodnight mouse.
 
Goodnight comb
and goodnight brush
Goodnight nobody
Goodnight mush
and goodnight to the old lady
whispering “hush.”
 
Goodnight stars
Goodnight air
Goodnight noises everywhere.
